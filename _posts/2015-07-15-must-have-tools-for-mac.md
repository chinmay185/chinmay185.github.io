I switched to using a Mac from a Linux machine few months back. I wanted to compile a list of tips and tools that I used to customize my workflow to make myself more productive. 

Following are the tools I use almost everyday. Some are Mac specific some are not. Do let me know in comments if you found this useful or if you have any better alternatives.

### Must have tools

* Clipboard Manager to copy and paste from clipboard history (I use [PasteBox](http://astevic.com/pastebox))

* [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)

* Markdown editor (I use [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/))

* [XtraFinder](https://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) with following configuration (makes life easy if you're coming from Windows or Linux OS)
	- Enter to open files and F2 to rename
	- Tabs like Google Chrome
	- Copy Path (Use Cmd + Shift + G to show the location bar and paste the file path)
	- Don't forget to enable Cut and Paste feature
	
* Window management tool (I like [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/))

* [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) (must have for any developer)

* [brew.sh](http://brew.sh/) kind of like apt-get for Mac

* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) Node Version Manager for managing multiple node versions

* [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) smart and user-friendly command line
shell for OS X

* [autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump) a `cd` command that *learns*

* [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) great offline documentation

* [Scroll Reversal](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) natural scrolling for trackpad and reversed scrolling for external mouse (this breaks three finger tap dictionary)

* [Cheatsheet](http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/) see all shortcuts for any app in unified interface

* A good text editor ([Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), or [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/) or any other)

* A good IDE (I love [IntelliJ Idea from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as it has support for various languages, frameworks and libraries)

* [Unarchiver](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353) for Mac

* Chrome Canary and Firefox Nightly if you're into web development.

* Misc like Limechat, Gitter, Slack and Skype, VLC,
